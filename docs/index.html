        <p>In the spirit of education, experiment and process, students from
            HfK Bremen, HfG Karlsruhe, Bauhaus-Weimar Universität, and joined by
            NYU Berlin will present a collaborative show around the themes of
            passing by, ephemeral media, and temporary spaces.
        </p>
        <p>Over the course of the weekend, the public will be able to see the
            result of students discovering and exchanging about each other’s

    <div class="name svelte-19fzd50">Nicolas-Fiedrich Hohlt</div>
    <div class="description">The more I walk through the forest that borders my parents‘ house, the more I notice its smaller and larger illnesses. He and most of the others are in bad shape. It has been lumbered, replanted, only to be lumbered again. Humans see it as their property. Yet it is home to countless living creatures and is actually a huge organism itself. The poem „Waldeinsamkeit“ (Forest Solitude) by Heirich Heine describes life in the forest with all its creatures and how they disappeared because people began to use it for themselves. The magic creatures disappeared and since then no one has seen them again. I wonder if some of them are still around and if they would show themselves, if they were met with kindness. If there is a chance of that happening, I think it will take a lot of time and patience. It would need a place to wait for them. That‘s the place I want to build. It has to be small. Just big enough to stretch out. With large openings so that everyone can see that someone is waiting for them. Birds should live in it too, the last ones that don‘t hide. The measurements were taken, the material has been ordered. I go back into the forest to understand what we have done to it and all those creatures who         live in it. Maybe he will talk to me and tell me a little bit about his suffering. Perhaps even the spirits come out of hiding</div>
    <div class="footer"><div class="bio svelte-19fzd50">My name is Nicolas-Friedrich Hohlt, I am an designer for temporary buildings. I am currently studying temporary architecture, in the Master‘s programme, at the HfK Bremen. Before my studies, I did work as an carpenter and learned how to use my hands. In my projects I work conceptually and holistically. For me, this means that at the beginning there is always theoretical research on the subject in order to be informed and to be able to pass on correct information. Both formally and in terms of content. The choice of material is based on a few essential considerations. How does it smell, how does its texture feel, is it warm or cold and how does it work with other materials and in what proportions? There are also questions about the sustainability and durability of the material. This creates spaces that can be experienced through smell, touch and sight. In the best case, a certain tension arises in the object that makes it interesting to look at, to stay in it and to deal with it .</div></div>

    <div class="name svelte-19fzd50">Marie Witte</div>
    <div class="description">The work in progress has been developed over the last days at Alter Wasserspeicher. The cracks are taken from the brick walls within the building. It is interesting how they can be understood. From a static point of view they appear as results of strains and tensions in bulidings. It is becoming obvious that the structure is not as durable and strong as we expected. At first sight a crack is a line that is finding its way through the wall. It is also a space in between. A sudden white space.</div>
    <div class="footer"><div class="bio svelte-19fzd50">Observations of materials and objects are the starting point for Marie Witte’s working processes. In the artistic exploration that follows up, it is about the clues that they can give and for possibilities that they reveal. It is a search on a content as well as a formal level. It becomes exciting when, starting from conceptual considerations, unexpected moments arise: new references and connections become recognizable. These explorations lead to installative works in which photographs, videos, objects and sound come together. In the best case, they relate to one another in such a way that a back and forth, a movement, develops.</div></div>

    <div class="name svelte-19fzd50">Jisu Kim</div>
    <div class="description">The safe spaces that surround us are not permanent.Various factors such as natural disasters, human construction and destruction, climate change, and war can alter our environment. The cycle of construction, wear and tear, repair, and reconstruction continues, and sometimes structures gradually deteriorate over time, unnoticed by anyone, until they eventually crumble, scatter into the air, and become part of something else. The project &lt;Beyond control>, which consists of a steel frame installation, sound, and performance video,inspired by the trauma experienced during earthquakes in Japan, aims to visually communicate the cyclical concept of construction, destruction, and the deterioration of structures. The trauma of the earthquake is played through video in the steel frame structure that shakes from side to side as if an earthquake had occurred. Performance videos, including the sound of construction, nature and earthquake warnings, show how buildings are affected by environmental changes and human actions.
Through this project, I reflect on how the safety of our surroundings can become unstable and examine the impact of natural disasters and human activities on buildings and the environment. It is also encouraged to contemplate the impermanence of the built environment and the interconnectedness of these processes.</div>

    <div class="description">My project is based on a story named The Peach Blossom Spring. The story expresses the ancient Chinese people's understanding of utopia.It was written during a time of political instability and national disunity. A fisherman rowed through a peach blossom field and found an ethereal utopia where the people lead an ideal existence in harmony with nature, unaware of the outside world for centuries. The video adopts the perspective of a fisherman, and the final text uses the description of this place in the original story. This description is also in line with some modern people's imagination of utopia.</div>

Most of the time, all we can listen to are silence and interferences, but after days listening to weather balloons and aircrafts, I can’t help but think that someone is trying to send a message.

    <div class="description">Is the city made for people? That is the initial question of the project.
 On the basis of 3 different places in the city of Bremen, the everyday changes in the city are documented. The pictures become montages, our view of what happens in the city every day changes. Urban structures emerge or disappear. The individual montages come together to form a panorama that shows how urban systems develop and change. The time at which each picture was taken will only be evident from a time stamp. Approximately 6 slide projectors will be used for the exhibition. The slide projectors will operate individually or synchronously, depending on the scene. With the help of a relay, an attempt will be made to switch and automate the individual projectors in analogue fashion. By combining image and sound (relays &amp; projectors), the effect of the image shown is intensified and transmitted into the room. 
 The projectors are positioned in a semicircle in front of a wall on the floor. The round shape of the walls is to support the panorama effect</div>

    <div class="name svelte-19fzd50">Gopal Muni</div>
    <div class="description">Everything that is drawn here was a reality on the surface. And now it is a reality several thousand kilometers from here. The shadow of horror that comes at the zero hour is always inherent in our world, do we see the seeds of this horror before it becomes our reality? We can't just stop it, we run into it regularly, so where does it all start?
This place was and remains a bunker. It can become it again, because it already is, while everything else has a variable nature, a warehouse, a storehouse, an exhibition hall, all this can sink into oblivion at one moment when it becomes dangerous outside again due to the fact that our society turned a blind eye to many of the actions taken in society itself. At the same time, the horror of war and destruction lives precisely in such places as this, in which it is quiet and calm, which are isolated from the outside world, in those in which you are safe when a hurricane of the madness of human nature is raging outside.
Dear spectator, I ask you to ask one question to yourself - where does the beginning of this horror lie in ourselves?

That thing that presents itself just as strongly in your chest after a breakup as it did at its beginning - only this time, somehow more confusing. Aptly expressed as the "human condition," I want to catalog, map, but most of all: explain - or make experiential - the inner world of human being. In this way I find not only the meaning of a work, but also myself. How can I speak before I have experienced? As a vehicle of my ideas - known as my "medium" - I rely on audiovisual installations. There is also a constant companion, which miraculously always finds its way into my works, supports me with advice, action and conversation: language. Writing things down releases them from my ephemeral flow of thoughts, tightens them, materializes them, and thereby lets me know what I was actually thinking.</div></div>

    <div class="description">"cross:erase:beyond" is a sound installation that involves scratching and drawing on vinyl records. The artwork embodies the notion of "erasing the boundaries that exist in the world" and aims to gather voices on various topics and issues. It seeks to express the experiences and instabilities of individuals who exist outside mainstream society, while emphasizing the incomplete nature and diversity of boundaries. Through the documentation of this artwork, it becomes evident that "cross:erase:beyond" serves as a powerful means of expression, utilizing scratches and unexpected noises to disrupt and challenge the traditional understanding of boundaries. In doing so, it invites viewers to question and reconsider the limitations imposed upon marginalized individuals, thereby promoting a more inclusive and diverse society.</div>

    <div class="description">Body &lt;-> City is a textile and paper collage that reflects our experiences living in Berlin in an abstract and instinctive way. Many of the ideas for the collage came about in the process of making it, with no strict visual goal in mind. This spontaneity resembles the surprises that come with navigating a new place, as well as the transformations in the self as a result of interactions in the city. We decided to focus on the body because being women of color have made it a central aspect of our lives. In this case, the body is not only a sensorial channel between the ego and the world, but also a filter that dictates how others will see us and therefore influence our experiences.</div>
