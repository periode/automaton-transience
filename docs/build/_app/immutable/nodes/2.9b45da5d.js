He and most of the others are in bad shape. It has been lumbered, replanted, only to be lumbered again. Humans see it as their property. Yet it is home to countless living creatures and is actually a huge organism itself. The poem „Waldeinsamkeit“ (Forest Solitude) by Heirich Heine describes life in the forest with all its creatures and how they disappeared because people began to use it for themselves. The magic creatures disappeared and since then no one has seen them again. I wonder if some of them are still around and if they would show themselves, if they were met with kindness. If there is a chance of that happening, I think it will take a lot of time and patience. It would need a place to wait for them. That‘s the place I want to build. It has to be small. Just big enough to stretch out. With large openings so that everyone can see that someone is waiting for them. Birds should live in it too, the last ones that don‘t hide. The measurements were taken, the material has been ordered. I go back into the forest to understand what we have done to it and all those creatures who         live in it.

For me, this means that at the beginning there is always theoretical research on the subject in order to be informed and to be able to pass on correct information. Both formally and in terms of content. The choice of material is based on a few essential considerations. How does it smell, how does its texture feel, is it warm or cold and how does it work with other materials and in what proportions? There are also questions about the sustainability and durability of the material. This creates spaces that can be experienced through smell, touch and sight.

The project <Beyond control>, which consists of a steel frame installation, sound, and performance video,inspired by the trauma experienced during earthquakes in Japan, aims to visually communicate the cyclical concept of construction, destruction, and the deterioration of structures. The trauma of the earthquake is played through video in the steel frame structure that shakes from side to side as if an earthquake had occurred. Performance videos, including the sound of construction, nature and earthquake warnings, show how buildings are affected by environmental changes and human actions.

The slide projectors will operate individually or synchronously, depending on the scene.

This place was and remains a bunker. It can become it again, because it already is, while everything else has a variable nature, a warehouse, a storehouse, an exhibition hall, all this can sink into oblivion at one moment when it becomes dangerous outside again due to the fact that our society turned a blind eye to many of the actions taken in society itself. At the same time, the horror of war and destruction lives precisely in such places as this, in which it is quiet and calm, which are isolated from the outside world, in those in which you are safe when a hurricane of the madness of human nature is raging outside.
